            <h2>Understanding Lent</h2>
            <p>
                Lent is a season observed by many Christians as a time of reflection, prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. It begins on Ash Wednesday and lasts for 40 days, excluding Sundays, leading up to Easter Sunday. This period symbolizes the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert before beginning his public ministry.

            <h2>The Significance of Lent</h2>
            <p>
                Lent is a time to spiritually prepare for the celebration of Easter by engaging in practices that allow individuals to deepen their relationship with God. This is often done through self-discipline such as giving up certain comforts, fasting, prayer, and acts of charity.

            <p>
                For many, it is a way to reflect on personal growth, repentance, and the path to redemption. It's a reminder of the sacrifices Jesus made and an opportunity to connect more meaningfully with one's faith.

            <h2>When Does Lent Start and End?</h2>
            <p>
                Lent begins on Ash Wednesday, which falls 46 days before Easter (40 days of Lent, with six Sundays excluded). The season ends on Holy Saturday, the day before Easter Sunday.
